This is my personal review note for CS229 Lecture 2.  

> All of materials are from Andrew ng's note which is uploaded on [Stanford CS229 website](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html).  

I need extra study about partial derivatives, matrix derivatives.    

Because I've not studied these part yet.
